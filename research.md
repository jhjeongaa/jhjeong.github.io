#### 1. Wireless soft capacitive strain sensor node development

Conventional resistive-type strain sensing methods have limitations in large-area sensing due to their relatively small size. The soft elastomeric capacitive (SEC) sensor is a capacitance-based stretchable electronic strain sensor developed by Dr. Simon Laflamme. SEC has shown distinct advantages for mesoscale sensing over conventional strain-based structural health monitoring (SHM) due to its wide surface coverage capability.

Conventional resistive-type strain sensing methods have limitations in large-area sensing due to their relatively small size. The soft elastomeric capacitive (SEC) sensor is a capacitance-based stretchable electronic strain sensor that has larger-area coverage up to several thousand mm2 and easy-to-install capabilities over complex geometries due to its highly elastic characteristics. Recent studies has demonstrated that the SEC sensor has a linearity up to measuring 20% strain and sufficient durability for structural crack monitoring, promising the performance in mesoscale sensing of static/dynamic strain responses for both concrete and steel structures
 While recent advances in wireless sensor technologies have provided an attractive alternative to wired and centralized SHM, the capacitive strain sensing methods have not benefitted from the wireless approaches due to the lack of appropriate hardware element. This study develops a wireless sensor board to use the SEC sensor in combination with a wireless sensor network for SHM by addressing key implementation challenges.
