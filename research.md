#### 2. Real-time generic target tracking for structural displacement monitoring under environmental uncertainties via deep learning

While structural displacement provides essential information about static and/or low-frequency dynamic characteristics of structural behaviors, full-scale measurement of absolute displacement in field structures is extremely challenging because of the requirement of fixed reference in most cases. Recent computer vision-based sensing technologies have advanced to the level of reference-free monitoring of full-scale dynamic displacement using generic features of the structure. However, current generic feature-based methods have limited to only short-term or campaign-type monitoring applications due to the intrinsic limitations of the computer-vision sensing under variable environmental conditions. This study investigates deep learning-based approaches for real-time computer-vision sensing that enables displacement monitoring using generic features under harsh environmental uncertainties. Siamese neural networks have been employed among others to address the environmental uncertainty issues, particularly caused by luminous condition change and obstructed vision, without sacrificing real-time processing capability.

#### 1. Wireless soft elastomeric capacitive strain sensor node development

Conventional resistive-type strain sensing methods have limitations in large-area sensing due to their relatively small size. The soft elastomeric capacitive (SEC) sensor is a capacitance-based stretchable electronic strain sensor developed by Dr. Simon Laflamme. SEC has shown distinct advantages for mesoscale sensing over conventional strain-based structural health monitoring (SHM) due to its wide surface coverage capability.

Conventional resistive-type strain sensing methods have limitations in large-area sensing due to their relatively small size. The soft elastomeric capacitive (SEC) sensor is a capacitance-based stretchable electronic strain sensor that has larger-area coverage up to several thousand mm2 and easy-to-install capabilities over complex geometries due to its highly elastic characteristics. Recent studies has demonstrated that the SEC sensor has a linearity up to measuring 20% strain and sufficient durability for structural crack monitoring, promising the performance in mesoscale sensing of static/dynamic strain responses for both concrete and steel structures
 While recent advances in wireless sensor technologies have provided an attractive alternative to wired and centralized SHM, the capacitive strain sensing methods have not benefitted from the wireless approaches due to the lack of appropriate hardware element. This study develops a wireless sensor board to use the SEC sensor in combination with a wireless sensor network for SHM by addressing key implementation challenges.
